This file contains the instructions to review he modules of the cache file:

1) Open the cache.xise file present in the CD.
2) Preferably use xilinx 64-bit navigator version 12.1 to open the file.
3) You'll find the modules designed in a structural heirarchy in the left window pane.
4) You can check the individual modules at each level for behavioral and syntax checks.
5) At the moment, the code is not able to simulate because    the Spartan-II FGPAs available in the lab and whose specifications are added in the module, don't support    double edge-triggering.
(For more information refer to: www.xilinx.com/support/answers/17023.htm )
6) You'll find the explanation for each module in the report.


We hope you enjoy the report and the design.
Thank You!
